# Understanding Quality Assurance Awareness in Open Source Software

Our research team conducted a large-scale survey to investigate how aware open-source software (OSS) developers are about quality assurance (QA) practices in their GitHub projects.

## Why This Matters

Quality assurance is crucial for software development, but it's unclear how aware developers are of QA practices in their projects. This awareness is important for making effective decisions about software quality.

## What We Did

1. We surveyed 471 maintainers and contributors of OSS projects on GitHub.
2. We asked about their awareness and use of various QA practices, including testing, code reviews, automation workflows, continuous integration, and project guidelines.
3. We analyzed the responses to gauge the level of awareness for each QA practice.

## Key Findings

1. Testing:
   - High awareness of test scripts (87%) and types of tests (85%)
   - Lower awareness of test coverage details (53%)

2. Code Reviews:
   - Generally high awareness (69-86% for various aspects)
   - Lower awareness of code review benefits (57%)

3. Automation Workflows:
   - 76% aware of workflow automation use
   - Lower awareness of specific types of GitHub Actions (52%) or Apps (14%)
   - Limited awareness of bot usage (46%)

4. Continuous Integration (CI):
   - 79% aware of CI configuration in their project
   - Only 57% know how and when to check CI results

5. Project Guidelines:
   - Moderate awareness (50-58%) of various types of guidelines

6. Maintainers vs. Contributors:
   - Maintainers generally more aware of QA practices
   - Contributors more aware of code review aspects and guidelines

## Implications

1. There's a need to improve awareness of certain QA practices, especially test coverage, automation workflow details, and project guidelines.
2. Tools and processes could be developed to increase visibility and understanding of QA practices.
3. Education and training programs could focus on areas where awareness is lacking.

## Why It Matters

By improving developers' awareness of QA practices, we can potentially enhance the overall quality of open-source software. This research provides a foundation for developing better tools, processes, and educational materials to support QA in OSS development.
