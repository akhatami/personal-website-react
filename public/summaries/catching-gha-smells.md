# Improving GitHub Actions Workflows

Our research team conducted a study on GitHub Actions (GHA), a popular tool for automating software development tasks. As GHA has been around for five years now, we wanted to see if we could identify common issues or "smells" in how developers set up their GHA workflows.

## What We Did

1. We looked at over 10,000 changes made to GHA configurations across 83 projects.
2. From these changes, we identified 64 common patterns and grouped them into 8 categories.
3. We then proposed 22 potential "smells" - practices that might negatively affect workflow quality.
4. To validate our findings, we created tools to automatically detect these smells and submitted improvements to 40 real-world projects.

## What We Found

- We identified several areas where GHA workflows could be improved, including security, performance, and general best practices.
- Developers were particularly receptive to suggestions that enhanced security and optimized performance.
- We successfully validated 7 of our proposed "smells" through developer feedback.
- Our automated tools for detecting these issues proved to be highly accurate.

## Why It Matters

This research helps developers create better, more efficient GitHub Actions workflows. It provides a foundation for best practices and could lead to improved tools for maintaining high-quality GHA configurations.

By optimizing these workflows, development teams can save time, improve security, and create more reliable automated processes for their projects.
